    "    - Returns the NPV (Net Present Value) of a cash flow series. Given a series of cash flows (values) and a discount rate (rate), the NPV is the sum of the present values of each cash flow. The present value of a single cash flow is the value of that cash flow divided by one plus the discount rate raised to the power of the number of periods elapsed. The number of periods elapsed is the number of times that the discount rate is applied. The discount rate is applied once per period. The discount rate is typically expressed as an annual rate, but can be any frequency. The number of periods is typically expressed in years, but can be any unit of time.\n",

    "- Cash flow projections: A detailed estimate of the expected cash inflows and outflows from the investment over time. This includes the initial investment, operational expenses, and expected revenue.\n",

    "- Time frame: The period of time over which the investment is expected to generate cash flows. This information is used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between NPV and IRR calculations is the output they provide. NPV provides the present value of future cash flows, while IRR provides the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero. Both NPV and IRR use the same input data and are used together to evaluate investment opportunities and make informed investment decisions."
